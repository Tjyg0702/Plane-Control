# Plane Control
This is a 2D game where the player is tasked with landing various types of planes on designated landing spots. Planes will spawn randomly on the map, and each type of plane requires a specific landing area to safely land. The goal is to ensure that all planes are landed successfully without collisions.

## Features：
- Random Plane Spawns: Planes will spawn at random positions, requiring the player to quickly plan and direct their landings.
- Different Plane Types: Multiple types of planes, each with unique designs and landing spot requirements.
- Landing Areas: Certain planes must land on specific runways or landing pads, indicated by visual markers on the map.
- Challenges: The game increases in difficulty as more planes spawn and require simultaneous landings.

## Gameplay：
- Control the direction of incoming planes.
- Ensure they land on the correct runways or helipads based on their type.
- Avoid crashes and land as many planes as possible!
